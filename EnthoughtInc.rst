Enthought has contributed to the development of SciPy_ since its inception in 2001.  We have very much enjoyed collaborating with the Open Source community that has grown around the SciPy_ library as well as Python for scientific computing in general.  Enthought's business model is centered around developing and promoting Open Source software (please see [`http://www.enthought.com/open/open.htm`_ our open source philosophy]).  Around 60% of all the code we develop is eventually released under the very liberal BSD-style license.

Enthought develops custom software applications in the Geophysics, Fluid Dynamics, CAE/CAM, Electromagnetics and Financial domains.  We specialize in the delivery of beautiful applications that allow the visualization and analysis of scientific data.
