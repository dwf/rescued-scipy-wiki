#format rst

Proposed documentation standards:

We are suggesting using epydoc as the means of providing basic reference documentation for contributed software http://epydoc.sourceforge.net  This allows extraction of web pages and pdf's with considerably nicer formatting and cross linking than is available in the ASTRON documentation.

Note that epydoc doesn't require anything complex on the part of the person documenting the software. It examines the structure of the code and extracts the doc string to generate the web and pdf documentation. When software starts appearing one will be able to see by example how it works.
