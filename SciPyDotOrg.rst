SciPy.org the Site
==================

**scipy.org** is a community site.  The term "SciPy" means different things depending on the context.  Here are some of the representations and various (at times, concurrent) meanings:

* SciPy.org (or scipy.org):

  * 1) the community of users of Python for scientific computing.

  * 2) the web site hosted at [`http://www.scipy.org`_ `http://www.scipy.org`_]

  * 3) a community domain and set of web tools offered to other Python based projects (see below) and maintained by the nice folks at EnthoughtInc_.

* SciPy:

  * the library of scientific codes built on top of NumPy_ and hosted at scipy.org

  * the annual conference (i.e. SciPy2007_) for scientific computing using python in which the SciPy and NumPy libraries share the stage with many other projects that use Python for science.

* Scientific Python:

  * Python library by Konrad Hinson not related to SciPy, but having similar goals.  See the `home page <http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/>`_ for more info.

About the scipy.org domain
--------------------------

The scipy.org domain is owned and hosted by [:EnthoughtInc:Enthought, Inc.], who supports and promotes the development of several Open Source initiatives.  The original site was launched February 19, 2001--before Enthought was even founded--as a first act of a fledgling entity and its collaborators.  Other subdomains hosted at scipy.org are for projects promoting scientific work in python.  Enthought's contribution to these projects is limited; from simple hosting of their web site to interested observation.  All these projects (much like SciPy_, now) are the products of their respective authors and community:

* [`http://ipython.scipy.org/`_ ipython.scipy.org]: **The** python interactive shell--accept no substitutes.

* [`http://mpi4py.scipy.org/`_ mpi4py.scipy.org]: Python MPI implementation]

* [`http://neuroimaging.scipy.org/`_ neuroimaging.scipy.org]: or NiPy, as it is known--functional imaging data analysis tool.

* [`http://numpy.scipy.org/`_ numpy.scipy.org]: The Official NumPy site.

* [`http://pyxg.scipy.org/`_ pyxg.scipy.org]: Python interface to Apples XGrid.

* [`http://sage.scipy.org/`_ sage.scipy.org]: Mirror site for the excellent SAGE project (Software for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation).

* [`http://swc.scipy.org`_ swc.scipy.org]: Software Carpentry site with excellent course material for an "intensive introduction to basic software development practices for scientists and engineers."

* [`http://wavelets.scipy.org`_ wavelets.scipy.org]: Libraries for wavelets-based algorithms in Python.
