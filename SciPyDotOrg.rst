SciPy.org the Site
==================

**scipy.org** is a community site.  The term "SciPy" means different things depending on the context.  Here are some of the representations and various (at times, concurrent) meanings:

* SciPy.org (or scipy.org):

  * 1) the community of users of Python for scientific computing.

  * 2) the web site hosted at `http://www.scipy.org  <http://www.scipy.org>`_

  * 3) a community domain and set of web tools offered to other Python based projects (see below) and maintained by the nice folks at EnthoughtInc.

* SciPy:

  * the library of scientific codes built on top of NumPy and hosted at scipy.org

  * the annual conference (i.e. SciPy2007_) for scientific computing using python in which the SciPy and NumPy libraries share the stage with many other projects that use Python for science.

* Scientific Python:

  * Python library by Konrad Hinson not related to SciPy, but having similar goals.  See the `home page <http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientificpython/>`_ for more info.

About the scipy.org domain
--------------------------

The scipy.org domain is owned and hosted by [:EnthoughtInc:Enthought, Inc.], who supports and promotes the development of several Open Source initiatives.  The original site was launched February 19, 2001--before Enthought was even founded--as a first act of a fledgling entity and its collaborators.  Other subdomains hosted at scipy.org are for projects promoting scientific work in python.  Enthought's contribution to these projects is limited; from simple hosting of their web site to interested observation.  All these projects (much like SciPy, now) are the products of their respective authors and community:

* `ipython.scipy.org <http://ipython.scipy.org/>`_: **The** python interactive shell--accept no substitutes.

* `mpi4py.scipy.org <http://mpi4py.scipy.org/>`_: Python MPI implementation]

* `neuroimaging.scipy.org <http://neuroimaging.scipy.org/>`_: or NiPy, as it is known--functional imaging data analysis tool.

* `numpy.scipy.org <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_: The Official NumPy site.

* `pyxg.scipy.org <http://pyxg.scipy.org/>`_: Python interface to Apples XGrid.

* `sage.scipy.org <http://sage.scipy.org/>`_: Mirror site for the excellent SAGE project (Software for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation).

* `swc.scipy.org <http://swc.scipy.org>`_: Software Carpentry site with excellent course material for an "intensive introduction to basic software development practices for scientists and engineers."

* `wavelets.scipy.org <http://wavelets.scipy.org>`_: Libraries for wavelets-based algorithms in Python.
