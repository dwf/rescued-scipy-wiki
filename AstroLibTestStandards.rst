Proposed Test Standards
=======================

Submitted code should at the very least come with some doctest tests but also could use unittest in its place. At least standard usage should have tests provided. Unresolved is where to put and control needed data files for tests.

* `doctest documentation <http://docs.python.org/lib/module-doctest.html>`_ 

* `unittest documentation <http://docs.python.org/lib/module-unittest.html>`_ 

Note that the use of doctest is generally quite simple. We will illustrate this later with examples when software starts appearing.
