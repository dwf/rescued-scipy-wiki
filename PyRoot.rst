[`http://cern.ch/wlav/pyroot`_ PyROOT] is a run-time based python binding to the [`http://root.cern.ch`_ ROOT] framework: ROOT is a complete system for development of scientific applications, from graphics and math libraries, to efficient storage and reading of huge data sets, to distributed analysis. The python bindings are based on run-time type information, such that you can add your own C++ classes on the fly to the system with a one-liner and down-casting as well as pointer manipulations become unnecessary. Using RTTI keeps memory and call overhead down to a minimum, resulting in bindings that are more light-weight and faster than any of the "standard" bindings generators.

PyROOT was presented at SciPy2006_ ([`http://cern.ch/wlav/talks/SciPy06_LavrijsenPyROOT.pdf`_ slides]).
