Tutorial Schedule
-----------------

**Note:** Tutorial registrations have reached our room capacity, so **new registration has been closed for tutorials** (7/20/07).  There will be a room provided as a sprint/work area during the tutorial days for those who have not yet registered, but want to show up those days and make use of the time during tutorials for sprinting.

Tuesday, August 14

**Notes:**

Please show up at 8:00am on Tuesday to grab a bagel and get signed in.

Bagels, snacks and lunch will be provided on the two tutorial days.

We had hoped to have 2 tracks, but were not able to get two rooms large enough to hold us.  We've pared the list down to 4 half-day tutorials that seemed to have the widest appeal.

"Using SciPy for Statistical Analysis" had been bandied about as a topic, but will instead be addressed a bit differently as a [:`SciPy2007/BoFs`_: BoF] and [:SciPy2007/Sprints: Sprint] for those interested in getting their hands dirty in the scipy.stats code.
