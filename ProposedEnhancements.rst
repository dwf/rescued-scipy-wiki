Proposed Enhancements
=====================

NumPy_ / SciPy_ are not big projects; most changes can still be made with a little discussion on the mailing lists. But occasionally changes prove contentious. Drawing on the experience of the wider python community, we solicit proposed changes in these cases in the style of `PEP <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/>`_s. We do not have a benevolent dictator for life, but the hope is that by presenting a single document describing the alternatives and providing example implementations and use cases for the proposed alternatives, the discussion will be clarified and the community can reach some sort of decision.
