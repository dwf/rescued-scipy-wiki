This repository contains the dump of the old SciPy.org Moin instance to
reStructuredText. This was accomplished with an updated version of moin2rst
available at http://github.com/dwf/moin2rst under the same license as the
original (GNU GPL).

We're keeping images in images/PageName, for now. Really we need to seriously
consider each and every page here and figure out where/if they belong on
the website. Plenty of things (including most/all of the Cookbook) can go into
the SciPy Documentation Editor (pydocweb) at a later date.
