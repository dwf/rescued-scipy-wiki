Some example code for how to plot an arrow using the Arrow function.

::

   from pylab import *
   from numarray import *
   x = arange(10)
   y = x
   # Plot junk and then a filled region
   plot(x, y)
   # Now lets make an arrow object
   arr = Arrow(2, 2, 1, 1, edgecolor='white')
   # Get the subplot that we are currently working on
   ax = gca()
   # Now add the arrow
   ax.add_patch(arr)
   # We should be able to make modifications to the arrow.
   # Lets make it green.
   arr.set_facecolor('g')
