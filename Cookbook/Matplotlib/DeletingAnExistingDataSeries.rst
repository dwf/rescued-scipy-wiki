Each axes instance contains a lines attribute, which is a list of the data series in the plot, added in chronological order. To delete a particular data series, one must simply delete the appropriate element of the lines list and redraw if necessary.

The is illustrated in the following example from an interactive session:

::

   >>> x = N.arange(10)
   >>> fig = P.figure()
   >>> ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
   >>> ax.plot(x)
   [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D instance at 0x427ce7ec>]
   >>> ax.plot(x+10)
   [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D instance at 0x427ce88c>]
   >>> ax.plot(x+20)
   [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D instance at 0x427ce9ac>]
   >>> P.show()
   >>> ax.lines
   [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D instance at 0x427ce7ec>,
    <matplotlib.lines.Line2D instance at 0x427ce88c>,
    <matplotlib.lines.Line2D instance at 0x427ce9ac>]
   >>> del ax.lines[1]
   >>> P.show()

which will plot three lines, and then delete the second.
