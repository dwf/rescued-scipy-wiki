The watershed algorithm (see [`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(algorithm`_)]) is used to split an image into distinct components.

Suppose that we have the following image, composed of three whites disks (pixels of value 1) and a black background (pixels of value 0). We want to obtain a new array where each pixel is labeled with the index of the component to which it belongs, that is a segmentation of the orginal array, as shown in the image below. We will use the watershed algorithm provided by scipy.ndimage, scipy.ndimage.watershed_ift.

   >>> # Create the initial black and white image
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> from scipy import ndimage
   >>> a = np.zeros((512, 512)).astype(uint8) #unsigned integer type needed by watershed
   >>> y, x = np.ogrid[0:512, 0:512]
   >>> m1 = ((y-200)**2 + (x-100)**2 < 30**2)
   >>> m2 = ((y-350)**2 + (x-400)**2 < 20**2)
   >>> m3 = ((y-260)**2 + (x-200)**2 < 20**2)
   >>> a[m1+m2+m3]=1
   >>> imshow(a, cmap = cm.gray)# left plot in the image above

The watershed algorithm relies on the *flooding* of different basins, so we need to put markers in the image to initiate the flooding. If one knows approximately where the objects are, and there are only a few objects, it is possible to set the markers by hand

::

   >>> markers = np.zeros_like(a).astype(int16)
   >>> markers[0, 0] = 1
   >>> markers[200, 100] = 2
   >>> markers[350, 400] = 3
   >>> markers[260, 200] = 4
   >>> res1 = ndimage.watershed_ift(a.astype(uint8), markers)
   >>> np.unique1d(res1) # pixels are tagged according to the object they belong to
   array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=int16)
   >>> imshow(res1, cmap=cm.jet) # central plot in the image above

If you don't know where to put the markers, and you know the minimal size of the objects, you can spread a lot of markers on a grid finer than the objects.

::

   >>> xm, ym = np.ogrid[0:512:10, 0:512:10]
   >>> markers = np.zeros_like(a).astype(int16)
   >>> markers[xm, ym]= np.arange(xm.size*ym.size).reshape((xm.size,ym.size))
   >>> res2 = ndimage.watershed_ift(a.astype(uint8), markers)
   >>> res2[xm, ym] = res2[xm-1, ym-1] # remove the isolate seeds
   >>> imshow(res2, cmap=cm.jet)
