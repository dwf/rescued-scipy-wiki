Well, it has turned out to be easier than giving up the sauce (at least for me), but only by a whisker.  In the end, the fix is incredibly simple (if you consider recompiling python and manually adjusting the auto-produced pyconfig.h incredibly simple, anyway).  After two solid days of commenting this and that out, recompiling everything and its mother 76 different ways from Sunday, poring over a legion of Solaris sys includes, slaughtering a few spotlessly white lambs and one pure black sheep, wrapping the bones and tendons and viscera in a double layer of fat and burning the offering to Delphic Apollo, I found the answer:

  1 download Python 2.4.2

  2 after extracting it and running ./configure, edit the generated pyconfig.h as follows:

    i) if _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined to be 600 (i.e., if the line "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600" appears in the file), redefine it to 500

    ii) if _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED is defined at all (i.e. if the line "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED 1" appears in the file), comment out its definition

  3 make && make install

The problem was with Solaris's support for the X/Open standards.  To make a long story short, you can use Open Group Technical Standard, Issue 6 (XPG6/UNIX 03/SUSv3) (_XOPEN_SOURCE == 600) if and only if you are using an ISO C99 compiler.  If you use X/Open CAE Specification, Issue 5 (XPG5/UNIX 98/SUSv2) (_XOPEN_SOURCE == 500), you don't have to use an ISO C99 compiler.  For full details, see the Solaris header file /usr/include/sys/feature_tests.h.

This is why muhpubuh (AKA matplotlib---long story) compiles on Solaris 10 if you have the big bucks and can afford Sun's OpenStudio_ 10 compiler.  gcc does not have full C99 support yet.  In particular, its lack of support for the wide character library makes the build go bust.  (See, e.g., `http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html`_.)
