Definitions
===========

* **Distribution name**: the name of the distribution. Used to distribute the package. Currently scipy_core.

* **Package name**: the name of the Python package. Conventionally, this is the same as the distribution name, although it is currently not so. Currently, this is "scipy" (which is a "namespace package", meaning it shares the "scipy" namespace with full scipy).

* **Module names**: names of modules within the package. Currently, the primary array functionality used directly from the "scipy" namespace.
