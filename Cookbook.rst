This page hosts "recipes", or worked examples of commonly-done tasks.    Some are introductory in nature, while others are quite advanced (these are at the bottom of the page).  We encourage new users to post recipes even for simple tasks that are not yet represented here.  Our goal is an easy learning experience for new users.  Some of these recipes may be incorporated into tutorials in the future.

Graphics
========

There are several packages available to produce interactive screen graphics (use the mouse to zoom, orient, and fine-tune) and publication-quality printed plots, in 2D, 3D, and 4D (animations).  These packages have releases more frequently than SciPy_.  Rather than bundling out-of-date packages with SciPy_, the plotting packages are released separately.  However, their developers work closely with the SciPy_ developers to ensure compatibility.

* ["Plotting Tutorial"].

.. THIS IS A BROKEN LINK!  Anyone have the page?

.. See also the [http://www.scipy.org/documentation/plottutorial.html old version].
