 **Off the beaten path: Advanced matplotlib features**

*John D. Hunter*

matplotlib makes it pretty simple to make simple plots, and for many users that is all that is needed. This talk ventures off the well worn paths into the more advanced features of matplotlib. Topics include the integration of matplotlib into graphical user interfaces; contouring and contour labeling; advanced text handling including fonts, unicode, mathtext, and native LaTeX support; GUI neutral event handling and widgets; the basemap toolkit; animations and customizations. The talk will emphasize interactive use of matplotlib from the shell and live demonstrations, and concludes with a discussion of future directions.
