Chaco

-------------------------

 *Chaco - Brandon* DuRette*, Enthought, Inc.*

Chaco is a Python toolkit for producing interactive plotting applications. Chaco applications can range from simple line plotting scripts up to GUI applications for interactively exploring different aspects of interrelated data. As an open-source project being developed by Enthought, Chaco leverages other Enthought technologies such as Kiva, Enable, and Traits to produce highly interactive, yet publication quality, plots.

We will demonstrate the features of the toolkit (complete with real-world examples), present significant recent improvements to usability and extensability, offer a brief tutorial, and present a roadmap for future Chaco development.
