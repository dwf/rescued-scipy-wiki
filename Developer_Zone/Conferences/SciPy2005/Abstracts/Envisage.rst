 *Envisage - Eric A. Jones, PhD., Enthought, Inc.*

Envisage is Enthought's open-source plug-in framework which borrows heavily from the idioms used in the Eclipse project (Java). Enthought uses this framework as the foundation of custom "applications" or collections of plug-ins.

We'll explain the fundamental structure of the framework and some core plug-ins that can be used for application building, how they interact and how they may be extended by other plug-ins.
