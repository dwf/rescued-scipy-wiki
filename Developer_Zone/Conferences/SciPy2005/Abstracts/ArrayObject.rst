 **The New Array Object for scipy.base**

*Travis E. Oliphant*

Over the past few years two array objects have emerged: Numeric and Numarray. This past year a reunification effort was started resulting in a new array object built on top of Numeric which adds the desired features of Numarray. This new array object is the base of newer versions of scipy. This talk discusses the hybrid array object in more detail including strategies for its widespread acceptance.
