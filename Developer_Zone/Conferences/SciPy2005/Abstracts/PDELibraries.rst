 **PDE libraries in Python**

*Matthew Knepley*

The FENICS (www.fenics.org) project is aimed at the complete automation of computational mathematical modeling. I will present a complete Python toolchain able to take a boundary, weak form, and element specification, and create and solve the resulting nonlinear algebraic system. Results from some large scale geodynamic simulations will be presented.
