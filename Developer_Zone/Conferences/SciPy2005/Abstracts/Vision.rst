Vision

-------------------------

 *Vision: a visual programing component: Michel F. Sanner*

Visual programming is a paradigm in which a user can drag and drop computational nodes and connect their input- and output- ports to create a computational network. A key feature of visual programming is that is enables users (i.e. scientists/ non programmers) to program without having to worry about syntactical details of a programming language or data structures used to represent data.

In this talk we will describe Vision, a Python package supporting the paradigm of visual programming. We will illustrate some of the unique features of Vision, describe its architecture and demonstrate using Vision as a standalone programming tool. Finally we will demonstrate the integration of Vision in a Python-based molecular visualization environment.
