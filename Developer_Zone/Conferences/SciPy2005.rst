  * [9/22/2005, 7:00pm PST, CalTech_]: The first day of SciPy_ held a variety of talks (strangely, several on PDE Solvers). Travis Oliphant began with a crash-free presentation of scipy_base (the new Numeric)--followed by a lightning talk/discussion of the array object proposed for inclusion in the next version of Python. Boldly declaring the intention to work up a PEP on the new array object by the day's end (see `http://numeric.scipy.org/array_interface.html Array Object`_), stay posted for an announcement/discussion soon. Many thanks to John Hunter, Bill Spotz, Matt Knepley, Daniel Wheeler, Ruth Huey, Fernando Perez and Dave Brown.

  * [9/22/2005 8:00pm PST, CalTech_]: During dinner, the vapor trail from a late evening launch of a `http://www.spacearchive.info/vafbsked.htm Minotaur`_ rocket from Vandenburg AFB gave quite a show from the steps of the Avery Library on CalTech_'s campus.

* [9/26/2005 3:00pm CDT, Back in Texas]: Friday's sessions proved as compelling as the Thursday presentations. Many thanks to all who attended and presented. Look for a poll coming soon to gauge opinion of several suggestions for improving SciPy_ next year.

This conference provides a unique opportunity to learn and affect what is happening in the realm of scientific computing with Python. Attendees will have the opportunity to review the available tools and how they apply to specific problems. By providing a forum for developers to share their Python expertise with the wider industrial, academic, and research communities, this workshop will foster collaboration and facilitate the sharing of software components, techniques and a vision for high level language use in scientific computing. This will be our second year as a conference and we look forward to a wide range of presentation topics and continued growth in participation.
