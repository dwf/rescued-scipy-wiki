Getting SciPy Packages Into Distribution
========================================

Each distributor has a different process for replacing the old package with the new one, packaging it in their format, testing the package, and including it in releases.  That process only starts when they pick up the new package, which may not happen automatically.  Please record here:

* Link to a web page where the distributor documents their release process.

* Link(s) to web page(s) for our package(s) in their system.

* Name(s) of people involved.

* *Their* preferred way to be notified of a new release.
