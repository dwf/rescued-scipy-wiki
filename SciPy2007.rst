This conference provides a unique opportunity to learn and affect what is happening in the realm of scientific computing with Python. Attendees will have the opportunity to review the available tools and how they apply to specific problems. By providing a forum for developers to share their Python expertise with the wider commercial, academic, and research communities, this conference fosters collaboration and facilitates the sharing of software components, techniques and a vision for high level language use in scientific computing.  For a little more background on what happens at a SciPy Conference, please see "[:`SciPy2007/WhatsThisConferenceLike`_: WhatsThisConferenceLike]?"

:superscript:`++` Note: Tutorial registrations have reached our room capacity, so **new registration has been closed for tutorials** (7/20/07).  There will be a room provided as a sprint/work area during the tutorial days for those who have not yet registered, but want to show up those days and make use of the time during tutorials for sprinting.
